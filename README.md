Base Python Manipulation Project is focused on mastering Fundamental Data Manipulation Techniques using Base Python. By diving deep into the foundational aspects of python, you will build a solid understanding that forms the basis for more advanced programming concepts and Application.

# Conditional Statement : if statement, if-else statement, if-elif-else statement, Nested-if
Conditional statement in python are used to perform different actions based on whether a certain condition evaluates to true or false.

# if Statement:
Executes a block of code only if a specified condition is true.

# if-else Statement:
It checks a condition and executes one block of code if the condition is true, and another block if it's false.

# if-elif-else Statement:
It checks multiple condition in sequence and executes the block of code associated with the first true condition.If none of the conditions are true,the else block is executed.

# Nested-if:
Nested if statement in python allow you to have an if statement inside another if statement.

# Loop : While loop , For loop , Nested loop
# While loop:
While loop is entry controlled loop.Four components of while loop are: (1) Initialization: to initialize a value. (2) Entry condition: to enter a while loop,the entry condition should be satisfied. (3) stopping condition: to stop the loop. (4) Increment or Decrement criteria: to move forward or backward the loop.

# Inheritance:
     Inheritance is a property in Object-Oriented programming(oop). In which derived class or child class inherits some properties of parent class.The child class able to access the methods and instance variables of a parent class then we don't want to create the object of a parent class.

# Types of Inheritance:
(1) **Single Inheritance**: A child class inherits only from base class. Here we have only one parent child relationship.

(2) **Multiple Inheritance:** A single child class can inherits the properties of more than one parent class. Here a single child and 
    multiple parents relationship.

(3) **Multilevel Inheritance:** A class inherits properties and behaviors from another class, which in turn may inherit from another 
    class. It is a step wise inheritance.

(4) **Hierarchial Inheritance:** ability of a subclass to inherit properties and behavior from multiple superclasses, forming a 
    hierarchical tree-like structure. This allows for the creation of increasingly specialized classes, each building upon the 
    characteristics of its parent classes.Here one parent and two child relationship.

(5) **Hybrid Inheritance:** It is the combination of single, multiple, multilevel and hierarchial inheritance.

# CONCLUSION:
Base Python Manipulation Objectives are focused on mastering fundamental data manipulation techniques using base python. Working with python data structures list,tuple,set and dictionary to store and manipulate data.Implementing user-defined functions to encapsulate reusable blocks of code.Using control flow statements like if-elif-else and loops to create interactive functionality.Enhancing the user experience by providing clear prompts and instructions.Over all this project covers basic functionality and provided a solid foundation in python programming.
