# BASIC-PYTHON-DATA-MANIPULATION-OBEJECTIVES
Base Python Manipulation Project is focused on mastering Fundamental Data Manipulation Techniques using Base Python. By diving deep into the foundational aspects of python, you will build a solid understanding that forms the basis for more advanced programming concepts and Application.

# Conditional Statement : if statement, if-else statement, if-elif-else statement, Nested-if
Conditional statement in python are used to perform different actions based on whether a certain condition evaluates to true or false.

# if Statement:
Executes a block of code only if a specified condition is true.

# if-else Statement:
It checks a condition and executes one block of code if the condition is true, and another block if it's false.

# if-elif-else Statement:
It checks multiple condition in sequence and executes the block of code associated with the first true condition.If none of the conditions are true,the else block is executed.

# Nested-if:
Nested if statement in python allow you to have an if statement inside another if statement.

# Lambda Function:
Lambda functions are anonymous functions. It contains a single line code and they don't have any name like UDFs.There are 3 functions are used with lambda function:map(),filter(),reduce(). For mathematical operation map() is used with lambda function and for filtering the data filter()is used with lambda function.

# CONCLUSION:
Base Python Manipulation Objectives are focused on mastering fundamental data manipulation techniques using base python. Working with python data structures list,tuple,set and dictionary to store and manipulate data.Implementing user-defined functions to encapsulate reusable blocks of code.Using control flow statements like if-elif-else and loops to create interactive functionality.Enhancing the user experience by providing clear prompts and instructions.Over all this project covers basic functionality and provided a solid foundation in python programming.
